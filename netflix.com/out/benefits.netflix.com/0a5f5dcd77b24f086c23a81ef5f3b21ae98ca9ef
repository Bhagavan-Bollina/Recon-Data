That decision has since become Netflix practice. \n\n*[beneficiary]: The person, or estate, that is designated to receive benefits in the event of your death."}]}]},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"3FXz2FDH6UqaEiGs8Ueq6q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-10-24T22:43:11.821Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-16T23:56:15.007Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":20,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"externalTab"}},"locale":"en-US"},"title":"Time is Valuable","locationBasedContent":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"6TR62i4eFUeUS60U60246C","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-10-24T20:46:17.325Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-18T18:57:59.829Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"locationBasedContent"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"Ext US - Work Not Drive","location":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"71tweP9sK440IwCGyUagK0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-07-30T16:29:50.993Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-11T18:45:08.775Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"locationData"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"United States","locationName":"United States","flag":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"3yIeCkVLluimeiYAqUWqEc","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-08-21T23:58:07.112Z","updatedAt":"2019-06-07T16:19:15.465Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"title":"us","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/3yIeCkVLluimeiYAqUWqEc/c36f12a041ea74cdc04b947c8eca0042/us_flag.svg","details":{"size":6757,"image":{"width":28,"height":20}},"fileName":"us flag.svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"},"slug":"united-states"},"locationSpecificContent":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"2520xv8F2Uey2kkkMQGqum","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-10-24T20:43:29.710Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-18T23:14:16.447Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionContent"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"Ext US Section - Work Not Drive","sectionTitle":"Work Not Drive","sectionDescription":"We know your time is limited and invaluable.
