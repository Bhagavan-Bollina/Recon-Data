			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Keep this in mind. Always.</h3>
			<p>Before you start marketing your show, it’s helpful to keep in mind why and how people listen to podcasts. For many, podcasts can be deeply personal. People listen not just for information, but also for a meaningful connection to topics and ideas they care about. And while listeners enjoy podcasts at different times, it’s the quiet moments when most people tune in. These moments soon become little retreats, “me time” that listeners look forward to and plan around.</p>
	<p>And how they listen is usually on iPhone. Earbuds in, headphones on, everything else drowned out. Which means, as a podcaster, your voice is literally in their heads. So how you promote your show matters. Because you’re not just making your podcast known to the world, you’re forming a relationship.</p>		</div>

		<div class="column large-7 small-12  large-pull-4 small-push-0">
			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Lead with the benefit.</h3>
			<p>With an endless supply of great content listeners can consume, your podcast needs to stand out. And you make that happen by being very clear about the benefits of your show. In other words, what’s in it for your listeners? Will it educate them on a complex topic? Inspire change in their world? Provide some much needed comic relief? Be prepared to share what your podcast is and why listeners should care. You want them to get the gist of your show at first glance. So lead with the benefit in all your writing and photography.</p>		</div>

			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Design for mobile.</h3>
			<p>The vast majority of podcast discovery and listening happens on iPhone, when folks are on the go. Which means you should think about all the ways you can optimize how you present your show. Make it easy for people to discover you on a mobile device.</p>
	<p><strong>Here are some tips to follow:</strong></p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Your website should be responsive. It should look good and function well on any device — whether it’s a smartphone or computer. All artwork and descriptions should work on mobile, too.</li>
		<li>Place the Listen on Apple Podcasts badges above the fold on your website, episode pages, email messages, and newsletters. (Above the fold is the part that’s visible before listeners have to scroll.) So if they’re quickly browsing your site, they can instantly subscribe and listen later.</li>

		<div class="column large-7 small-12  large-pull-4 small-push-0">
			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Direct your audience.</h3>
			<p>Your show needs to be easy to find, especially for anyone new to podcasts, so be specific. iOS devices are in the hands of millions of people all over the world. Use the Apple brand to your advantage. Tell the audience where to get your show: “Listen on Apple Podcasts and subscribe,” “Go to Apple Podcasts to subscribe and share.” </p>		</div>

			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Make a plan.</h3>
			<p>You’re about to release your first show. Or maybe it’s your 50th. Whatever the case, it’s important to think beyond just getting it out there. Creating a marketing plan is the best way to ensure you’re not merely trusting that people will find your show. Identifying who your audience is, how you’re going to reach them, and ways Apple can help all go into your plan.</p>		</div>

			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Design thoughtfully.</h3>
			<p>A podcast’s identity goes far beyond cover art. It includes all the ways your show is visually represented on Apple Podcasts, social media, and your website. Smart branding provides insight into what your show is about. Create an identity that communicates the tone and subject matter of your podcast.</p>
	<p>Let’s talk logos for a sec. Your logo might look great enlarged in whatever design app used to make it. But does it look good at thumbnail size? Consider using clear, large font and relevant imagery.</p>

			<p>When you describe your show, be sure to talk about the content. Explain the benefits and why listeners should care. When it comes to episode titling, lead with the most important information first — like big-name guests, trending topics, or exclusive interviews.</p>

			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Create a brief.</h3>
			<p>A brief about your podcast is a great way to share the vision of your show and package up all the information for advertisers, networks, or Apple. A brief is not a marketing plan. Marketing plans provide more in-depth information. Briefs are shorter and contain high-level details. That said, your brief should contain the following elements:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="column large-5 small-12">
			<ul class="list list-nobullet list-brief">
				<li><strong>Podcast Name</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Host</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Host Bio</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Description</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Context </strong></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="column large-7 small-12">
			<ul class="list list-nobullet list-brief last">
				<li><strong>Business Objective</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Target Audience</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Duration and Frequency</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Launch Date</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Most of these items are self-explanatory, but let’s clarify a few. Context explains why you created your show in the first place. In other words, what problem is it trying to solve? Your business objective outlines what you expect to accomplish and how your show fits into your organization’s strategic goals. Your target audience is the people you’re hoping to reach — fans of historical-fiction TV shows and movies, for example. Duration and frequency lay out how long each episode is and how often they’re produced.</p>
	<p>In addition to attracting an audience, you may want to get the attention of advertisers. And maybe earn a little positive press coverage to boot. Talking about your show in a clear manner that highlights your compelling content can make all the difference in users discovering and listening to your show.</p>		</div>

			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Produce trailers.</h3>
			<p>Just like with blockbuster movies, podcast trailers pique interest. So consider creating a prelaunch trailer to introduce listeners to your show. But keep it short and simple. Two minutes or less should do the trick. Tease just enough information to generate interest. And highlight important events like the beginning of a new season, special guests, new features, or a big story.</p>		</div>

		<div class="column large-7 small-12  large-pull-4 small-push-0">
			<h3 class="typography-headline-reduced draweritem-headline">Collaborate with other podcasts.</h3>
			<p>Cross-promotion is another way to generate buzz about your podcast. If you can, make guest appearances on other shows. This gives you the opportunity to plug yours. If you have a big-name guest coming on your show, spread the word about it. And use in-kind promotions to your advantage — hype up other podcasts on your show, while they do the same for yours. There are millions of people who have never listened to a podcast before, so think of other podcasters in your category not as competitors but as colleagues.</p>		</div>

			<p>Tentpole programming means creating content centered around popular cultural moments. This is anything from trending topics on social media to major holidays to movie releases. Think Emmy Awards or Black History Month. Basically, whatever people are buzzing about. An episode schedule that reflects what’s going on right now has built-in promotional value. And Apple might feature your show as part of a collection.</p>		</div>

			<p>Social media is your ally. It’s a relatively easy way to promote your show and engage with your audience. So get in the habit of posting regularly on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Reddit. For starters, Instagram Stories is a creative and simple method to get your followers to tap over to Apple Podcasts. Consider posting things like a quick, behind-the-scenes video or a poll tied to an upcoming episode. Whatever you do, just start the conversation and keep it going. Create and post native content for social media platforms and link directly to Apple Podcasts to drive listeners to your show. And don’t forget to tag us in your posts — @ApplePodcasts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>		</div>

			<p>Sometimes you have more to say than 280 characters will allow. So why not do it in email or newsletter form? Either of these methods is great for sharing details that entice people to listen to your podcast and spread the word. Name-drop popular guests, share feedback or reviews, ask for show ideas. Email and newsletters help you cultivate a relationship with your listeners. So make sure your communications are targeted and specific. Listeners will unsubscribe to email and newsletters when messages are irrelevant and useless to them.</p>		</div>
